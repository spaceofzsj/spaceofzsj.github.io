# Basics of Sets
>*This part is relatively simple, so I will only list the definitions and properties instead of elaborating it.*

<!--more-->

In mathematics, a [*set*](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Set_(mathematics)) is a collection of elements. Every item in a *set* is called an *element* or *point*. If $x$ is an element of $X$, then $x$ belongs to $X$, and we denote it as $x\in X$. $\notin$ means "not belong to". A set doesn't contain any element is called an *empty set*, which is denoted by $\emptyset$.
>**Definition 1:** If every element in a set $A$ belongs to the set $X$, then $A$ is a subset of $X$, which is denoted by $A\subset X$ or $X\supset A$. $\emptyset$ is a subset of any set. $A$ is called a *proper subset* of $X$ if $A\subset X$ and $A\neq X$. $A=B$ if $X\subset Y$ and $Y\subset X$.






To be continued...
P.S. I'm currently working on the chapter 3 and will come back to here later. This part is too boring...XD
