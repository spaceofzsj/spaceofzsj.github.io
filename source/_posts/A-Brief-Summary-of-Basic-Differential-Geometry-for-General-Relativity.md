While learning general relativity, I feel necessary to write down what I have already mastered and some thoughts of my own for future reference. So I will start from the basic differential geometry for general relativity. The following topics are what the note will cover.  

>1. [**Topological Space**](https://spaceofzsj.github.io/posts/1d583a28.html)
>2. **Manifold and Vector Field**
>3. [**Riemann Curvature Tensor**](https://spaceofzsj.github.io/posts/48c07248.html)
>4. **Lie Derivative, Killing Field and Hypersurface**
>5. **Differential Form and Integration on Manifolds**

**The notes will be regularly updated.**
